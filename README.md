### About
I was curious about how different investing strategies might compare against one another.
So I built this to help me do calculations and back test strategies using prices of ETFs such as the S&P500. 

Ideas:
Variable Frequency 
Graphing
Add data from other stocks

Paper Trading. Server sending out data (daily) but the tick rate can be increased. Fast would squeeze 10years into an hour. Normal would make one decade one day. The server would return the 'current day' and all the data up to that day. For example, normal paper trading would start 2014 at 12am and deliver the last records in 2024 around 11:59pm, while that cycle would run once an hour for the fast version.
